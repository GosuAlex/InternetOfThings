# InternetOfThings
Made with Arduino IDE for a IoT course in my bachelor degree. All the sounds on the video is very low.

#### Joystick.ino
This sketch takes the input form a PS2 joystick. It prints out the X Y coordinates of the current position of the joystick, along with the most North, West, East and South pointing way the joystick is leaning towards.

#### Distance.ino
Measures the distance and prints it. 

#### AlarmSystemV1.1.ino
A simple alarm system prototype. It measures the distance on start and if there's any change in the measurement the alarm will trigger. A buzzer will start beeping when the alarm triggers. To turn of the alarm a pin code has to be inputted on the keypad, and the sound will turn off.
